# Action Required!

It looks like this git repo is missing pull request task config `.githubTaskManager.json`, so i'll try some default status checks for now until this is fixed.

Take a look at https://github.com/wyvern8/github-task-manager/wiki/Creating-a-Task-Configuration
and work with your team to create a config file for your repo.

I'll keep reminding you on each pull request.
